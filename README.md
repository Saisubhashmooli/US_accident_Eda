# US_accident_Eda
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and summarizing the main features of a dataset, often using statistical graphics and descriptive statistics. In the case of a US accident dataset, EDA could involve examining various attributes of the dataset, such as:

Time and location of accidents: One of the primary attributes of the dataset is the time and location of accidents. EDA could involve analyzing the distribution of accidents across different times of the day, days of the week, and months of the year. Additionally, it could involve plotting the location of accidents on a map to identify high-risk areas.

Severity of accidents: Another important attribute of the dataset is the severity of accidents. EDA could involve analyzing the distribution of accidents across different severity levels, such as fatal, injury, and property damage only accidents.

Contributing factors: EDA could also involve examining the contributing factors to accidents, such as weather conditions, road conditions, and driver behavior. This could help identify the most common causes of accidents and inform interventions to reduce their occurrence.

Vehicle types: The dataset could also include information on the types of vehicles involved in accidents. EDA could involve analyzing the distribution of accidents across different vehicle types, such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, and bicycles.

Demographic information: The dataset may also include demographic information about drivers involved in accidents, such as age, gender, and ethnicity. EDA could involve analyzing the distribution of accidents across different demographic groups to identify patterns and trends.

Overall, EDA of a US accident dataset could provide valuable insights into the causes, patterns, and trends of accidents, which could inform interventions to reduce their occurrence and improve road safety.
